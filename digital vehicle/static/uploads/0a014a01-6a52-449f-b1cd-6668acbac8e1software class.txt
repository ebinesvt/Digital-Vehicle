source code--compile-->object code--linking or binding-->executable file(.exe)
(compiler of c tcc.exe)
second scenario - in oops
linking at runtime 
keeps its indivduality in .exe

needs dynamic binding for suppourting polymorphism

SECURITY IN OBJECT ORIENTED LANGUGE

heap - less secured area(static,global)(main)
stack - highly secure(member var,member fun)
os can only enter into heap
object is used to give access for heap to stack(public)
through function object can access from public to private in stack
